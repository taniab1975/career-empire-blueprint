# Approved playable school avatar repair

CE-CHANGE-20260910-35, 10 September 2026. Tania approved the local result and explicitly requested live publication.

Uses the supplied original Schoolboy.glb with only L_Forearm and R_Forearm animation rotations repaired to remove destructive axial twist. Geometry, textures, weights, skeleton and 121 other animation channels remain byte-identical to the original. Original authored material settings replace the older segmented overrides. Existing character identity, uniform, scale, walking speed and profile save/return remain.

Repaired asset SHA256: fe6fa382bd5cbbee9ea5118203d178c160835bc4a6adeefc80a05f96e5f45e93.
